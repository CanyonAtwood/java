# C-tic_tac_toe
# Overview

{Hi in this project for my class CSE 310 we have been assigned to learn a new subject for our focus. We call them Sprints. I chose for this second sprint to be learning Java. I am a newer developer with limited experience, though most of mine has been in Python and in HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JavaScript  and my last sprint was a small C++ tic tac toe assignment so this is new. I am looking forward to learning the language and the sytax seeing how it differentiates from other progamming languages and see how I can use this language to make me a better developer. }

{I think that for me the best way to learn is practical application of something that I can see. So, I thought that learning a simple tic tac toe game would be useful to learn the syntax of C++, classes, lists, functions etc. I think that this is going to make me a better at the language considering the amount of troubleshooting involved in learning the game and it will be easy to determine what I need to fix considering that the rules of tic tac toe are pretty straight forward. }

{My purpose for writing this software is simple, to become a better programmer and to understand the syntax of Java and be able to take the language and put it into practical application of the snake game. }

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* I need to do better at my classes that was very difficult for me to understand
* I need to improve on my loops, this was difficult to keep track of due to the syntax of C++ and how much more complicated it is than python 
* Overall I need to make more comments and be better organized
